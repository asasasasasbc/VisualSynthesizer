How to run the project:

There are two ways to run this project:

	Option1: Open ProgramGUI.py via Visual Studio Code and then Ctrl+B
	
	Option2: (Windos OS): Double click the 'run.bat' to run the program.

After you started the program, you can click '[Load MusicXML File]' and then select 
'canon.xml' or 'Waltz_in_A_MinorChopin.mxl' to play these starter MusicXML file!

If you want to play the .synnote file, after click  '[Load MusicXML File]' , in the file
choosing dialog's bottom right corner, change the file type from 'Music XML file' to 
'Custom defined music note' and then select 'CustomMusic.synnote.' Now the program
will play this synnote file!

Additional Note: (Important!)

This program's computation task is heavy, if this program is laggy or crashs frequently, you probably need a computer with better CPU to run this program. Another fix option is to run this program in stable mode (simple graphics mode.) In program's setting menu, there is a load config.ini button, click it and then select config_stable.ini. In this mode, this program requires less computation power and will be less laggy.
